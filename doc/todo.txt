========================================
TODO for 0.14


 *Add/fix probedigit
 * flanker task--make neutral version flanked by lines (or at least add the condition) (DONE)
 *switcher task--add debriefing (DONE)
   - move mouse cursor a bit after each click so letter is not obscured. (DONE)

 * setting bgcolor of a window doesn't seem to work; it 
     distorts the color (at least one created with RGBColor) (FIXED)

 * PropertyExists does not seem to work right (workaround with IsProperty in Utility.pbl); (now fixed).

* look at Mueller-lyer illusion for better instructions (they appear not to change; works as intended)
* Look into WritePNG on windows. (fixed)
* Figure out d prime/beta calculation (done)

 * fix/workaround or document font limitation to around 1000 fonts (mostly fixed; limit is now much higher, although not perfect)
 * bring in satest fixes made to enable varying predator size and screen size. (DONE)
 
* (temporary) xy coordinates of objectsmessedup. (fixed)
- Seems to be a problem with setting x/y location of images that are scaled?  (Fixed)

-Some crash in dots task with new evaluator. (fixed)
 * Sublist does not provide useful error feedback. (DONE)
 *TOH output is messed up supposedly. (DONE)
 * Cannot enter | into text box... (fixed)

 *fix subject code text getting blurry. (Done)
 *Incorporate PAR scoring into BCST (DONE)

* Mental Rotation: At least for version 0.11, there was a ton of output that takes (at least for us non-Linux users), a fair amount of post-processing. If it was possible to have a report which has the mean time and percent correct for each angle of rotation, that'd be helpful. (DONE)

* Iowa: The Psychological Assessment Resources version has a brief (500 msec) delay after each selection. This helps to limit the potential that people just respond quick but thoughtlessly. There also is an audio component after each a response (I think it was a "cha-ching" after $ gained, a buzzer after $ lost). (DONE)


 *nback hangs on second block???
 -Runaway crash on demo/NBack.pbl  (maybe with new evaluator)(works now (or does it))

 * Fix GetInput mouse event (DONE)
 * Fix multi-parameter stuff (DONE; removed this; 
                        need to fix the schema file for some test)
  *Add ui for parameter sets files (DONE)

Verify:

2) Berg: If it'd be possible to get the mean (or median) response time for each response category, that'd be helpful. Admittedly, I may be the only one interested in these measures but I think there's some interesting info in these end-points that folks haven't considered because it wasn't available for the traditional (physical card) version.

- New trail test (Salthouse's one). **Completed.

-Document transition from list to vector; access to lists via [] not yet possible. **Complete

Transpose seems to give a wrong answer for Transpose([[1,2]]), Which I think should be [[1],[2]]  FIXED--it does give this answer.

- PrintProperties only works on widgets; should work on all objects. (it should work on network objects and ports etc.) PUSH

EasyLabel can't accept a number in the text variable. Maybe it should?

- possibly, do checking for screen size under fullscreen mode. (**DONE)

- Fix cr/lf in windows battery files. (mostly fixed)

- Have consistent solution to getting subject code in battery tests. (mostly fixed)

- File selector: 
                 Add a +1 button to subject code? ***Done

- we seem to get unknown feedback if you use a variable that hasn't
  been defined???? (probably the stderr problem) ***

  elsewhere?) ***done


=============================================
Push to 0.13 or Later

getText seems not to work on labels

 - Let lists be defined with more whitespace options.  Currently,
    things like this seems to fail:
  a <- [[1]
       ]
     
 - Make a function that unloads the window but keeps running the PEBL.

- Launcher: randomize experiment chain
    -save chain to a .bat file?
    -data compiler?

 - document GetMinDist (But this is just a helper function)

- Print("") a message in test batteries about where data is saved.  Maybe link that to FileClose()?

 - add reporting for TOL of additional statistics. 
 - make a report for trails test.


- Colorblind issues in TOL, Others?

- makeImage will load a non-graphics file happily, but segfault

- seteditable() works, but .editable doesn't

-allow if() statements to be empty.  *Maybe works
-syntax _should_ handle, shouldn't it?:
}
else
{



- itemorder test uses Z/Zed; change to length 7???




- BCST: report median RTs for different response conditions
- BCST: try the Piper alternative scoring method.
